## Description

This is a simple note taking app.  There is a frontend application that provides the user interface and an express backend that saves the notes in a db.json file.  This allows the notes to be stored persistently.  There is functionality to view notes, create new notes, and delete notes.

## Technologies Used

The frontend is programmed in Javascript, using JQuery.  The pages are created in HTML and styled in Bootstrap.  The backend is programmed in Javascript using Node and Express to create the server.

There are multiple routes for HTML and API that serve the data to the client application from the server.  The persistent data is stored in a .json file.  It uses GET, POST, and DELETE routes.
